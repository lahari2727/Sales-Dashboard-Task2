

Objective: The goal of task-2 is to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI using the cleaned sales data to analyze sales and profit performance.


What I Did

-I created an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI based on cleaned sales data.
-Then I created DAX measures for Total Sales and Total Profit.
-I used a bar chart to show sales by product and a column chart for profit by country.
-I added a Pie Chart to display Profit % by Product Category and a Card for overall Total Sales.
-To make it interactive, I used a slicer to filter by year and product category.
-Finally, I arranged all visuals neatly, added colors, borders, and gave the dashboard a proper title.
